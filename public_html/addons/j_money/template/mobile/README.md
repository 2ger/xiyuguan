## Features ([Demo](http://mottie.github.com/Keyboard/))

### Ease of use

* An on-screen virtual keyboard embedded within the browser window which will popup when a specified entry field is focused.
* The user can then type and preview their input before Accepting or Canceling.
* It can be set to always remain open, and to not use a preview.

### Ease of installation

* Grab the files as a zip, or from npm or bower - see the [installation](#installation) section below.
* In a minimal setup, the keyboard works by including:
  * jQuery
  * jQuery UI theme
  * (optional) jQuery UI position utility to position the keyboard at the input/textarea element
  * Initialize keyboard - no options needed for qwerty keyboard.

### Ease of setup

* Add custom keyboard layouts easily.
* Multiple region specific keyboard layouts included in a separate directory. This is a work in progress and slowly growing.
* Add up to four standard key sets to each layout that use the shift and alt keys (default, shift, alt and alt-shift).
* Add any number of optional modifier keys (meta keys) to add more key sets.
* Each meta key set can also include the shift, alt and alt-shift keysets.
* Position the keyboard in any location around the element, or target another element on the page (using jQuery UI position utility).
* Easily modify the key text to any language or symbol.
* Allow direct input or lock the preview window.
* Set a maximum length to the inputted content.
* Scroll through the other key sets using the mouse wheel while hovering over a key to bypass the need to use alt, shift or meta keys.
* Easily type in characters with diacritics. Here are some default combination examples:
    * `'` + vowel ( vowel with acute accent, e.g. `'` + `e` = `é` )
    * `` ` `` + vowel ( vowel with grave accent, e.g., `` ` `` + `e` = `è` )
    * `"` + vowel ( vowel with diaeresis, e.g., `"` + `e` = `ë` )
    * `^` + vowel ( vowel with circumflex accent, e.g., `^` + `e` = `ê` )
    * `~` + certain letters ( letter with tilde, e.g. `~` + `n` = `ñ`, `~` + `o` = `õ` )
* Enable, disable or add more diacritic functionality as desired.
* Use callbacks and event triggers that occur when the keyboard is open or closed and when the content has changed, been accepted or canceled.
* Includes ARIA support (may not be fully implemented).
* Built in watermarking. It emulates HTML5's placeholder, if the browser doesn't support it.
* Include validation using a callback function so third-party validation methods can be used.

### Themes

* jQuery UI themes are used by default.
* Bootstrap themes ([original](https://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/gfgkb4o1/) or [dark](https://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/emLfqchq/)) can also be applied.
* Or add a completely custom theme (without using jQuery UI position utility):
  * [Light](https://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/jsh0377k/) using [keyboard-basic.css](https://github.com/Mottie/Keyboard/blob/master/css/keyboard-basic.css).
  * [Dark](https://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/6dmqhLvh/) using [keyboard-dark.css](https://github.com/Mottie/Keyboard/blob/master/css/keyboard-dark.css).

### Extensions

* Alt-keys: Show alternate keys in a popup after long-clicking on a key.
* Autocomplete: Integrate with jQuery UI's autocomplete widget.
* Caret: Add a caret with custom styling.
* Extender: Add a togglable layout (e.g. toggle number pad)
* Keyset: Show shift, alt or meta keyset within the virtual keyboard - custom styling.
* Mobile: Use with jQuery Mobile.
* Navigate: Use arrow, home, end &amp; page up/down to navigate inside of the keyboard.
* Scramble: Scramble the entire keyset or by row
